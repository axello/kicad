# kicad playground

Just starting with kicad, this is a hodgepodge of small electronics projects, mostly centered around the ESP8266.

## ESP-RS232
A small-footprint design to connect an ESP8266 to a DB9 RS232 interface. Useful to connect to powerbars, power supplies, air quality sensors, solar panel controllers and whatnot.

## ESP-Sensors
A design to test the non-breadboardable ESP8266-12E with various sensors. It has a small prototyping area to solder different sensors on.
